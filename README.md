# Smart-Rabbit-API
This project is a Node.js-based API designed to streamline logistics services by connecting stores with drivers for efficient order delivery. The application supports key features such as user authentication, order tracking, and wallet management. It is built to handle the following roles: Stores, Drivers, and Admins.

## Key Features
 ### Store:
 Registration and Authentication: Stores can register on the platform, upload necessary documents (national ID, tax number), and log in to request deliveries.
 ### Driver:
 Registration and Authentication: Drivers can sign up, log in, and view available delivery orders to accept.
 ### Order Management:
 Stores can request deliveries, view order statuses, and track orders in real-time.
 ### Driver Operations:
 Drivers can accept orders, update order status, and mark orders as complete upon delivery.
 ### Admin Management:
 Admins can manage users, oversee store and driver activities, and intervene in disputes or issues.
 ### Wallet Management:
 Both stores and drivers have wallets to manage their finances, with features for top-ups, withdrawals, and balance adjustments.
